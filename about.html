            <h2>How I Got Into Tech</h2>
            <p>I first got into tech in middle school at an engineering camp run
                by an NC State professor, where we used Python and Raspberry Pi
                to automate simple tasks. In high school, I built on that by joining
                the robotics team, working on both code and hardware. Since then, I
                have focused on projects that connect that hands-on engineering mindset
                with my interests in business and markets.
